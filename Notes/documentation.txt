*** Broken things

** Window

The minimum width of about 80 pixels, is that a Windows 
thing or a Win32::GUI thing?


** Label

-noprefix doesn't seem to work.

-fill doesn't seem to work

-frame doesn't seem to work for the color values


** Button

-bitmap together with -align and -valign makes the alignment 
and valignment weird (center becomes left e.g.)

-align and valign are pretty funky to begin with



** Icon/Bitmap

Does anyone know if an "icon" handle is pretty much the same as a bitmap?


** Tooltip

It's not halfway implemented, right? Looking at the API it 
seems like a lot of work. On the other hand, it is a 
_really_ good user interface element.


** ListView

The ListView seems to lack a working default -style, so this:

-style => WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | 1

from the samples/listview.pl is required or something. 
Without it, the control behaves _really_ weird.


** TabStrip

-right works like -bottom should, and -bottom doesn't have any effect.

Unsure about the use of ImageLists.
