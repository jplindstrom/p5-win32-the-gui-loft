<P>Win32::GUI::Loft Programmer's Reference -- how to
incorporate The GUI Loft windows into your Perl programs

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="introduction">INTRODUCTION</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="what is it">What is it?</A></H2>
<P>Win32::GUI::Loft is the Runtime part of The GUI Loft.</P>
<P>The most important class is Win32::GUI::Loft::Design, which
is used to build the designed windows at runtime. A few
important methods are discussed below.</P>

        my $objDesign = Win32::GUI::Loft::Design-&gt;newLoad($fileWindow) or
                        die(&quot;Could not open window file ($fileWindow)&quot;);</PRE>
<P>loads the Window from file. You can load the file yourself
and build the window like this:</P>
<PRE>
        my $fhIn;
        open($fhIn, &quot;&lt;$fileWindow&quot;) or die(&quot;Could not open file ($fileWindow)\n&quot;);
        binmode($fhIn);         #Note! It's a storable image
        local $/;
        my $code = &lt;$fhIn&gt;;
        close($fhIn) or die();</PRE>
<PRE>
        my $objDesign = Win32::GUI::Loft::Design-&gt;newScalar($code) or
                        die(&quot;Could not build window file ($fileWindow)\n&quot;);</PRE>
<P>This may be used if you e.g. get the window definition (the 
contents of the $code variable in this example) from 
something other than a file; e.g. a database or a file 
handle. Remember to use <CODE>binmode()</CODE> if you read the file 
yourself.</P>

<H1><A NAME="installation">INSTALLATION</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="the win32::gui::loft runtime">The Win32::GUI::Loft Runtime</A></H2>
<P>Install the PPM packages found in the ``PPM'' directory. <STRONG>Run
install.bat</STRONG>.</P>
<P>The Runtime module is used in your programs to create the
windows. You'll need to install the Runtime before you try
the Demo programs.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note</STRONG>: You will need to run install.bat each time you
download a new release! install.bat will remove, then
reinstall the new modules.</P>
<P>Also, make sure the following modules are present:</P>
<PRE>
        Win32
        Win32::GUI</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="the gui loft application">The GUI Loft Application</A></H2>
<P>There is a binary and a source distribution.</P>
<P>The binary is totally freestanding. Just run the program,
and it should work.</P>
<P>The source relies on the Runtime, so install the PPMs first.
The source is also dependent on the modules found in the
Modules dir. Install them, then run the Perl file
``lib/tgl.pl''</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="demos">DEMOS</A></H1>
<P>The Demo programs are located in the Demo directory. After
you have installed the Runtime PPMs, just run the Perl
scripts to see them in action.</P>
<P>The code is commented to point out interesting and important
things, so a code walkabout could be educational.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="password">Password</A></H2>
<P>A simple demo of the Win32::GUI::Loft::Design class.</P>
<img src="pic/windowdesign.gif" width="224" height="102"><P>To demonstrate the timer, I chose to implement one very good
user interface detail in some versions of the e-mail program
Eudora; when Caps-lock is active, Eudora will warn the user
that the password probably will get screwed up. The demo
warns regardless of the Caps-lock state.</P>
<P>Things to learn from:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
How to create the window
<P></P>
<LI>
How to access the window from event handlers
<P></P>
<LI>
Password-style textfield
<P></P>
<LI>
Button with bitmap image
<P></P>
<LI>
Timer used to blink text (yeah, I know... :)
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="fetchurl">FetchURL</A></H2>
<P>Enter a URL and Fetch will do a GET and display the HTTP
headers and the raw HTML.</P>
<P>This is a great example of a quick GUI wrapper around a
simple Perl program.  A colleague asked if I knew how to see
the HTTP response of a GET request.</P>
<P>-``Sure, that's a few lines of Perl''</P>
<P>Whining. -``Isn't there a Windows program to do that already?''</P>
<P>Well, fifteen minutes later, there was. And I spent most of
that time trying to find the HTTP::Response method returning
the HTTP headers (headers_as_string).</P>
<P>Things to learn from:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Keep the .gld file opened in The GUI Loft while you browse
the code. You'll need to check control names and stuff.
<P></P>
<LI>
Look at how the Resize properties are set.
<P></P>
<LI>
Look at how the TabStrip is done using Clusters.
<P></P>
<LI>
In the btnFetch_Click event handler, take note of how to
access the Win32::GUI Window object and the contained
controls, e.g. $win-&gt;tfURL-&gt;<CODE>Text()</CODE>
<P></P>
<LI>
How to use a ControlInspector to modify the controls in the
window at build time.
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="filedisplay">FileDisplay</A></H2>
<P>Simple program to display files in a RichEdit control.</P>
<P>Things to learn from:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
How to attach a menu to your window during the build.
<P></P>
<LI>
How to manually code the resizer stuff when there is a
Splitter control involved.
<P></P>
<LI>
How to separate the actual GUI code from your application
code as much as possible.
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="the gui loft">The GUI Loft</A></H2>
<P>For real world examples, look in the Loft\resource
directory. Here you can find the windows and dialogs used in
The GUI Loft.</P>
<P>If you decide to experiment or change anyhing, it might be a
sligthly clever idea to make a backup copy first. But you
already knew that... ;)</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="the demo programs">The Demo programs</A></H2>
<P>Until this section gets a little more complete, the best way
to learn is to check out the code in the Demo programs.</P>
<P>It's not overly complicated, and the demos are nicely
commented.</P>

<H2><A NAME="adding menus">Adding Menus</A></H2>
<P>Adding a menu to your window is really simple.</P>
<P>Create the menu the usual way, create the Design object,
then set the mnuMenu property before you actually build the
window. An example from the FileDisplay demo program:</P>
<PRE>
        my $fileWindow = &quot;filedisplay.gld&quot;;
        my $objDesign = Win32::GUI::Loft::Design-&gt;newLoad($fileWindow);</PRE>
<PRE>
        $objDesign-&gt;mnuMenu( Win32::GUI::MakeMenu(
                        &quot;&amp;File&quot;                                         =&gt; &quot;mnuFile&quot;,

<P>There is a method <CODE>rhClusterWingc()</CODE> on your Design objects

<P>$deisgn-&gt;<CODE>rhClusterWingc()</CODE> is a hash ref with (key = Cluster
name, value = array ref (with Win32::GUI controls)).</P>
<PRE>
        #Let's say your created window is called winTest

<P>
<H2><A NAME="custom controls">Custom controls</A></H2>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="inspecting and changing options">Inspecting and changing options</A></H2>
<P>Each control can be altered at build time using a subclassed
Win32::GUI::Loft::ControlInspector object. You can -
addstyle, -remstyle, etc. and basically change the entire
list of options passed to the method creating the control.</P>
<P>The Demo program FetchURL is an example of this, changing
the background color of the window (to an ugly color...
sorry), and adding a style to the window, making it a
ToolWindow.</P>
<P>Study the method ``buildOptions'' in the FetchInspector.pm
file for hints on how to do this.</P>
<P>Note that you might have to remove existing options before
adding your own.</P>

<H2><A NAME="using perlapp et al">Using PerlApp et al</A></H2>
<P>The GUI Loft binary is a PerlApp application, and so any
program you write using Win32::GUI::Loft should work equally
well in that regard.</P>
<P>This is actually a really handy little program, since
it totally eliminates the deployment problem.</P>
<P>I haven't tried using Perl2Exe and other similar programs,
but there are reports that at least Perl2Exe works well.</P>

<H1><A NAME="on gui coding">ON GUI CODING</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="what no perl code">What? No Perl Code?</A></H2>
<P>Originally, I planned to have The GUI Loft generate Perl
code to build the window in addition to have a runtime
module create it. I have since abandoned that idea.</P>
<P>Why? There are certainly advantages with producing code:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Programmers new to The GUI Loft will feel better when they
can see that ``yes, this is my Perl code''. It's tangible, and
nothing is hidden in a weird class they didn't write
themselves.
<P></P>
<LI>
People can learn from it. Create things in WYSIWYG mode,
export as Perl and see exactly how this or that was done.
Using Win32::GUI should ideally mean that the programmer is
exposed to Win32::GUI code and familiar with how it works.
<P></P>
<LI>
Code can be tweaked to produce 100% what's desired. If it's
possible within the realms of Win32::GUI and Win32::API, it
can be done no matter what.
<P></P>
<LI>
Clever programmers can easily add controls not yet supported
by The GUI Loft.
<P></P></UL>
<P>However, there are a few disadvantages with exported code
that need mentioning:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Generated code is ``one way''. If you're gonna modify it,
which is kind of the point, parsing it is bound to be
fragile and random at best. Not something I would like to
rely on anyway.
<P></P>
<LI>
Generated code is static, running code is dynamic. Say you
tweaked your code to perfection and then needed to change
the layout in The GUI Loft? Regenerate the code and retweak?
Argghhhh!!! What a maintenance nightmare!
<P>With The GUI Loft you <STRONG>can</STRONG> provide code to tweak the
controls during the build. You can also incorporate Custom
controls in your Design and later on generate them with
code, giving you the best of both worlds.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
Maybe a minor point: the generated code is unlikely to
comply with your coding standards.
<P></P>
<LI>
As I started to implement more and more features of The GUI
Loft I came to the realisation that any Perl code I would
generate to produce the same result would inevitably require
a lot of runtime modules (at <STRONG>least</STRONG> Win32::GUI::Loft::Design) to work
in order to avoid duplicate code; The GUI Loft (or rather
the class Win32::GUI::Loft::Design) had become an extension of
Win32::GUI.
<P>My vague future plans emphasize this even more, but let me
give them some more thought before I elaborate.</P>
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="use window state">Use Window State</A></H2>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="gui vs. application">GUI vs. Application</A></H2>
<P>Separate the specifics of your current GUI implementation
from your application as much as possible.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="debug events with carp">Debug Events With Carp</A></H2>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="knowing win32::gui">Knowing Win32::GUI</A></H2>
<P>The GUI Loft will shield you from code. That's good and bad.</P>
<P>It's good because you don't need to know everything about a
subject to be able to use it, the same way you e.g. don't
need to understand the finer points of the POP3 protocol to
use Mail::POP3Client. That's reuse of code and knowledge.
That's what will bring productivity gains.</P>
<P>But it's also bad, because The GUI Loft can only take you so
far before you run into things that aren't implemented, or
that fall outside the scope of the program. Then you have to
do the difficult things yourself anyway (only with a solid
base and a nice framework). But you still have to do the
work.</P>
<P>So, study Win32::GUI code and learn how things are done. Use
the help files under the Help menu. If you are going to use
Win32::GUI then you'll have to know how it works. There is
no way around that. And when the capabilities of Win32::GUI
ends, you'll have to look at the Win32 API and Aldo's
Win32::API module. Get used to it.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="the internals of win32::gui">The Internals of Win32::GUI</A></H2>
<P>If you're serious about Win32::GUI, I recommend a brief tour
of GUI.xs and GUI.pm.</P>
<P>You'll get a better view of what's in there, and a few hints
of what you need to look for in the Win32 docs. Armed with
